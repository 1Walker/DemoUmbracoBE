        Below is a custom list view demonstrating the ability to integrate third party systems within an Umbraco installation. The products are currently pulled from a surface controller
        returning dummy data, though would be best suited to external API endpoints (such as a stock or financial management systems).
    </p>

    <p>
        The potential for a list editor is huge, as you can create a completely bespoke management system within Umbraco that can be pushed over to a different system.
